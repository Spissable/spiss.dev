Hi, I'm Lukas. I'm a software developer currently based in Porto, Portugal with roots in South Tyrol, Italy.

Besides my obvious passions for programming and Linux, I love football (Juventus FC), cooking a decent meal and visiting gaming buddies all across Europe.

If you put pineapple on your Pizza or cut your Spaghetti, you deserve to rot in hell. However, if you are into dark humor then treat yourself to the Netflix specials of [Daniel Sloss](https://www.netflix.com/title/80223685) - thank me later.

Anyways

Peace
