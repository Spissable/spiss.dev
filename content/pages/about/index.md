Hi, I'm Lukas. I'm a software engineer currently based in Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ with roots in South Tyrol, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹.

Besides my passion for software engineering, I love football (Juventus FC), cooking a decent meal and relaxing at the beach.

If you put pineapple on pizza or cut your spaghetti, chances are that we're not gonna be friends ðŸ™ƒ. If you are into dark humor then treat yourself to the Netflix specials of [Daniel Sloss](https://www.netflix.com/title/80223685) - thank me later.

Anyways

Peace
