      <guid>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiss.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;clearlinux&#x2F;</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After over a year of exclusively using Arch Linux on my work laptop, the distro hopping itch has gotten the better of me and I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearlinux.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Clear Linux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a try. And since I don&#x27;t do half arsed things, I wiped my disk and used Clear Linux as my main distro... at least for a while.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zola-continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation experience was very straight forward, similar to the one of Ubuntu I&#x27;d say. The graphical interface leaves next to no room for mistakes and presents you with a ready-to-go system with just a few clicks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I was missing was F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System) support, which is my preferred filesystem. However, at the time of me writing this post, a pull request adding support for it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clearlinux&#x2F;clr-installer&#x2F;pull&#x2F;654#event-3079095310&quot;&gt;merged&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first thing I noticed when booting Clear Linux, was actually the boot process itself. It is &lt;em&gt;blazing fast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;! Despite full root encryption. I also found confirmation of that impression &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Clear-Linux-Kernel-3s-to-300ms&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the default desktop environment of the distro is Gnome, I was then greeted by the Gnome Desktop Manager. A choice I very much support, as Gnome gives a very complete desktop experience in my opinion, including support for X11 and Wayland.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, all the software I installed was up-to-date, which is one of the big promises on the distros website.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the software I installed was up-to-date, it still cost me quite some frustration. Clear Linux offers a lot of its packages in bundles, e.g. the desktop-dev bundle, which includes lots of different packages which you might need or might not. As for me, I prefer being in control of what is being installed, rather than having to get a whole bundle of things of which half of it is useless to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another packaging format that is supported is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Flatpak&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. A containerized, distribution independent packaging format which claims to be &amp;quot;The Future Of Apps On Linux.&amp;quot; As they offer Visual Studio Code, which is my main code editor, I gave it a try. First problem, the integrated terminal was not working as I was used to. The Z shell didn&#x27;t respect my config files, certain executables weren&#x27;t usable... and I am &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;vscode&#x2F;issues&#x2F;44646&quot;&gt;not the only one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, only 1 week into the experiment, my Gnome Wayland setup didn&#x27;t load anymore, but instead I was greeted with a black screen on log-in. The X11 variant still worked though, so I tried to repair it from there. However, attempt after attempt the frustration grew bigger and bigger and I really need my system to be reliable at work, so I just decided to pull the plug and re-install the trusted Arch Linux.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still glad I gave Clear Linux a try and despite the problems that I faced, I am still very impressed how far this very young distro has come. Especially the performance is astonishing, and I hope other distros can integrate some of Clear Linux&#x27;s patches. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the next up and coming distro, whichever it might be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

      <title>i3wm - the world of tiling window managers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: If you prefer your system to be production ready right away, shiny to the very last pixel and intuitive without spending some time to get used to it, then i3 is most likely not for you. For anyone else, enjoy the post and I hope you&#x27;ll give it a try yourself! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zola-continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;floating-vs-tiling&quot;&gt;Floating vs. Tiling&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The window manager landscape for the Linux ecosystem is quite crowded. Major names like Gnome, KDE or XFCE satisfy most users&#x27; needs and give a lot of room for customization. One feature that unites them is, that they are all floating window managers. It&#x27;s the concept of dragging windows around freely (mostly with your mouse), probably everyone is familiar with from using Windows or MacOS. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, there are tiling window managers like i3, awesome or herbstluft, just to name a few. They are way less popular amongst the average user, but the concept of automatically tiling windows by default, not just helps you to stay organized, but enforces it. And once you get accustomed to it, you&#x27;ll find your workflow to be vastly improved in speed. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i3wm&quot;&gt;i3wm&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i3wm is my window manager of choice for some years now whenever I&#x27;m working on a Linux machine. Initially I encountered it during a presentation at the university. I had been using Linux for years at that point, but I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the concept of tiling window managers. Clearly impressed, I installed it right away and well... it was a game changer. A few of the main features (for me):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiling (duh.)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binding applications to workspaces&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal &#x2F; Vertical &#x2F; Tabbed &#x2F; Stacked &#x2F; Floating&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration in a single config file&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;binding-applications-to-workspaces&quot;&gt;Binding applications to workspaces&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to stay truly organized in a tiling window manager environment, it&#x27;s quite fundamental that your windows open in pre-defined workspaces. Otherwise your screen would become really crowded, really fast. This is how I organize my workspaces:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: Browsers&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Editors&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3: Terminals&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4: Communication&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5: Music&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratchpad: Notes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this setup, I got my everyday needs covered. It became second nature to me and going back to any other window manager without this feature (which I occasionally do, because I love to experiment) is just a pain in the ass.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All keybinds, workspaces etc. are configured in one config file (~&#x2F;.config&#x2F;i3&#x2F;config). While this might be a little bit intimidating at first, it becomes more and more advantageous with time. i3 has a great documentation for beginners, making it actually quite easy to tailor the window manger the way you like it. And once configured, you can just backup your configuration file and have it ready whenever you decide to install a new OS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-tools&quot;&gt;Additional tools&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polybar:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Alternative, feature rich and beautiful statusbar&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rofi:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Application launcher, window switcher and much more&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Udev rule + systemd service + bash script:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to properly manage monitor hotplug&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;helpful-ressources&quot;&gt;Helpful ressources&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3wm.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;i3 documentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swaywm.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Sway (wayland implementation of i3)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
